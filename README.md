# mkcd
Unix terminal command for creating a directory and moving into that directory in the same command.

## Setup
Download the `mkcd.sh` file and place in a directory. Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file (or `~/.bash_profile` if running mac):
```
. ~/<insert-path-to-directory>/mkcd.sh
```
When you've saved that, run the following command, or simply restart the terminal (replacing `~/.bashrc` with `~/.bash_profile` for mac):
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Running
To run the program, enter the following command:
```
mkcd name-of-new-file
```
